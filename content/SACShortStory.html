<p>"Well, how's it going Dad?"</p>
<p>These hopeful words were spoken to a broad chequered back cross-strapped by dungarees. James stepped cautiously into the hotness and, closing the sheeted timber door behind him, sat down lightly beside him on the end of a bale of straw.</p>
<p>"Not so good, son."</p>
<p>"When do you think it'll happen, Dad?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, son. She's labouring hard but still can't get them out. I think they're breached cross-ways inside her."</p>
<p>"And what about Pat Morgan?"</p>
<p>"Sure your mother has walked over to Donnelly's and rung him three times already. But she couldn't get the hold of him. And, anyway, even if you could get him on a Sunday evening, sure he'd be in no fit state."</p>
<p>The heavily pregnant young gilt was lying on her side (like a big pink balloon about to burst, James thought) on a straw bed. Her eyes were closed and she was moaning steadily in distress. She lay with her coarse-haired back hard against a timber barrier. There was a gap at the bottom of this where the piglets could slip through. Beyond the barrier lay a narrow run where they could find sanctuary from her flailing bulk when they came. If they came.</p>
<p>An infra-red heat lamp hung down on a long flex tied with baler twine to the rafter. Dusty cobwebs pulsed in the rising waves of heat. The air in the piggery, thick with ammonia, cut into James' eyes. He got up and walked over towards the door where some fresh air was whistling through a gap at the frame. Condensation formed a slick skin on the inside of the cold plastered walls. James stood with his back to the door as if he wasn't even there. As if all he could do was look.</p>
<p>At Dad. A gentle giant sitting forward &mdash; elbows on knees. Big hands and thick fingers knitted through one another. James wondered was he praying. Those wind-weathered cheeks with their fine red-veined traceries seemed to have sagged slightly. His breathing was slow and heavy. In the thick light he looked a bit older. James was slightly shocked when his father finally spoke - as if answering some imagined criticism.</p>
<p>"I'd try to get them out myself but my hands are too big and I'm afraid of hurting her. Sure it's her first litter."</p>
<p>James stared straight ahead. He was thinking too. He had always been the small one &mdash; 'the wee man'. Weaker than his brother, he thought of himself as more hindrance than help around the farm. But still. Dad had always been patient and never passed harsh comment. Because of that very gentleness James hated to see him troubled like this. He would try to be brave.</p>
<p>"Could I not do it, Dad?"</p>
<p>"Well, are you sure about it son?" His father's was a mixture of hope and uncertainty. "It's not an easy job".</p>
<p>But James was determined to grasp this rare opportunity out of his brother's shadow. Soon he was standing shivering in the scullery. His old jumper sleeves were rolled up as far as they would go and his skinny hairless arms were in a zinc basin being scrubbed with warm water and being coated with an antiseptic jelly.</p>
<p>He knelt behind the gilt and with his dad's steady whispered guidance, pursed his fingers like a cobra's head and inserted them into the dilated opening. Lying on his side, James could feel the coldness of the concrete floor through a thin layer of wet straw. He wriggled forward. As far as his wrist. As far as his elbow. His arm inched up the warm slippery canal. James considered the feeling not altogether unpleasant. He was almost up to his shoulder when his fingertip finally touched a hardness - slimy and wriggling.</p>
<p>"I've got something now, Dad," he said, giddy that he had at least got this far. "Is it the back or the snout?" His Dad sounded almost giddy too.</p>
<p>"Hold on." James willed his fingers further into the canal. The folds of his soggy jumper were now pressing hard against the gilt's backside. This time when he spoke to his father his words rebounded off the gilt's anus.</p>
<p>"It's the snout, Dad&hellip; I think!"</p>
<p>"Good boy. Now hook your finger around the wee head &mdash; careful you don't hurt its eyes &mdash; and pull it towards you. Gently now!"</p>
<p>Good boy. That was all that James needed to hear. Buoyed by the praise, he manoeuvred his fingers nimbly to clasp the tiny head and pulled it round to face forward. Then, pressing with his forehead down into the wet straw so that he could take the weight off his shoulder, James wriggled himself back inch by tentative inch. As his elbow emerged, the job got easier and he felt like the gilt was helping him. He got himself into a kneeling position now and drew the piglet out gently until it emerged gowned in a bloody membrane. He opened the tiny jaws and scraped the clogging mucus out of the frantic squealing mouth. The gilt gave out a loud groan soon after. Out came a rapid succession of slippery siblings, all wriggling frantically.</p>
<p>"She's fair firing on all cylinders now, son". His father's eyes were wet with joy.</p>
<p>James and his father took turns, clearing out airways and drying them down with handfuls of soft straw. When they were satisfied, with the arrival of the afterbirth, that the full litter had been delivered, James' father drew a jute bag across his knees. He grabbed each bonham in turn, snipping the tips off their sharp teeth with fine clippers so the sow would not reject them. He then handed them to James to apply a daub of iron paste onto their tongues with a wooden spatula before returning them to their mother's exposed dugs. The little heads locked onto the engorged teats as they began to suckle, eyes firmly shut, oblivious to all else in their short stifling world.</p>
<p>In the heat, the slime had by now turned into a sticky, drying crust on James' arms and the sagging sleeves of his jumper. James thought he should have felt tired and drained. But he felt none of this. His father put his hand on James' shoulder and smiled a soft proud smile. "Good man".</p>

<h2 id="ch2" class="title">I'm not on the tram</h2>
<h3 class="author">By Helen Morris</h3> 
<p>Tam eased his arm carefully out from under her warm body and tentatively emerged from the cocoon of the duvet. He picked up his phone from the bedside table and tiptoed out of the bedroom. It was five o'clock in the morning and, being early March in Edinburgh, still pitch black outside. Tam stumbled into the sitting room and was just about to install himself on the settee when he noticed a mound of blankets and remembered their pal Percy had crashed out the night before rather than face the uphill cycle home.</p>
<p>He had no choice but to make the unheated kitchen his centre of operations. He pulled on an old Aran jumper and some jeans and mismatched socks and sitting at the table, his feet propped against the opposite chair, he typed in the address of the online auction site. It was less than an hour before the auction ended. Six in the morning was certainly a curious time to pick for the bids to end but the seller was in Australia where presumably it was a much more sensible time of day. Offline, Tam checked the Wi-Fi on his phone, switched on but no signal. No need to panic, he grabbed the tablet, nothing, the old laptop held together with duck tape, no signal. He checked the modem, the light was red and solid. He yanked the plug out of the wall, counted one thousand, two thousand &hellip; thirty thousand, power on, still nothing. OK backup plan, Internet caf&eacute;, library. Not at 5 a.m.</p>
<p>There had to be internet somewhere in the city. The cooker clock showed 0511. Tam slapped his forehead with the palm of his hand. Of course, the tram! First departure York Place 0529.</p>
<p>He stole quietly back into the sitting room and carefully lifted Percy's keys off the floor. He headed out the flat door, down the tenement stair and out onto the still icy street.</p>
<p>Percy's bike was locked to the railings, the long chain lovingly intertwined around the wheels, frames and fence. There were two distinct frames expertly &mdash; at least Tam hoped they were &mdash; welded together. Percy's great-great grandfather, a schoolmaster in Kegworth, had joined what had once been two tandems into a magnificent quad bike. Speeding around the hairpin bends of Nottinghamshire on a Friday after school had helped him blow off steam after another week battling with the school board.</p>
<p>Tam had only ever been a passenger on the contraption while Percy steered but it hadn't looked that hard, at least not from where he had been sitting. At this hour of the morning Easter Road was mercifully clear of traffic and only a couple of food delivery vans pulled out in front of him as he turned into London Road. He safely negotiated the roundabout at the top of Leith Walk by crouching low and tilting the quad in what Tam felt was the style of a TT racer, past the Playhouse and around the final roundabout he saw the tram pulling into the stop. His plan was going to succeed! The Edinburgh Trams Customer Service agent hovered in the vehicle doorway and Tam fished into his pocket for money to buy the ticket.</p>
<p>No wallet! A trickle of cold sweat ran down his back.</p>
<p>He patted his pockets desperately but, no money, only his phone. He quickly connected to the tram Wi-Fi and found the auction. The price was still within his budget, he would just have to hope the last minute bidders were slower than him.</p>
<p>Clang, clang the doors closed and the tram trundled off along York Place. Tam leapt back on the quad, balanced the phone in one hand and steered with the other just managing to stay in touch with the Wi-Fi signal but had no free hand to refresh the screen and see how the auction was going. The phone half slid out of his hand as he turned the bike past the Portrait Gallery and pedalled uphill to St. Andrew Square. The incline wasn't steep but with only one hand on the handlebars and a gearless bike made for four, Tam was struggling to keep up with the tram. 'Have youse nae pals?' A couple of squaddies looking like they were on their way back from a night out, yelled at Tam from the gardens in the middle of the square.</p>
<p>'Gisa shot.'</p>
<p>'Help me pedal?' Tam said hopefully.</p>
<p>The lads lurched onto the back of the bike and began to pedal. The tram headed down the hill to Princes Street. Tam now had more power but as the squaddies whooped and hollered from the back, a lot less stability. Where was their commanding officer when you needed him?</p>
<p>The tram paused at the Princes Street lights and Tam took the time to hit refresh and confirm the auction was still on course. As they passed the Overseas Club a woman dressed in pilot's uniform stepped briskly out onto the pavement. She caught Tam's eye and taking in his unruly crew couldn't resist slinging her bag across her shoulders and jumping onto the last seat from where Tam could hear her barking brisk orders at the hapless squaddies to pedal fast and in an orderly fashion. With the power and order behind him Tam was easily able to keep up with the Wi-Fi signal as the tram pondered along the tranquil streets.</p>
<p>'I'll need to leave you at Haymarket,' the pilot yelled to Tam. 'I've a plane to catch. The passengers get upset if I'm late for work.'</p>
<p>'Aye nae bother. Thanks for your help.'</p>
<p>Tam was feeling quite relaxed as they all headed into Shandwick Place. He used the West End stop as a chance to shake out his fingers which had become cramped clutching the phone over the top of the handle bar.</p>
<p>As they approached Haymarket, Tam was getting ready to say good bye and thanks to his pilot when he noticed that the tram tracks dipped down and away from the road. As the pilot stepped onto the tram with a smile and a wave, the doors closed and the vehicle, rapidly picking up speed, disappeared.</p>
<p>Tam hung his head and felt his spirits plummet as his great scheme had come to nought. He signalled to the squaddies to turn the quad around, trying to cross the tracks at a right angle as instructed by the man from the Council.</p>
<p>Clang, clang.</p>
<p>'Hey, hey,' the squaddies cheered as the York Place bound tram arrived at the stop. They were back on.</p>
<p>As the unstable, but no less enthusiastic, trio chased the tram back along Princes Street, Tam put in his first bid. Immediately it was beaten. He waited a couple more minutes watching the clock on his phone until he was sure it was the last 15 seconds of the auction. As the tram and the quad with only three men sped back down North St. Andrew Street, he bid again. Auction over.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have won!</p>
<p>'Ya beauty!' Tam raised both arms in the air, looked skywards and closed his eyes, victorious. The quad had picked up speed on the downhill and now without its driver to steer it around the corner to York Place was heading straight for Dublin Street. The side of the front wheel clipped the bollards at the top of the street, the force of the impact was too much for the elderly bike, one quad became two tandems, Tam and the squaddies flew in different directions, part of the frame skidded down the cobbled street, the wheel still spinning in the air as it came to rest beside an elderly red Honda.</p>
<p>On the other side of the street in the gutter a mobile phone beeped, congratulations on winning the auction for an antique engagement ring. The seller will be in touch to arrange secure delivery.</p>

<div id="ch3" class="title">Freight train, going so fast</div>
<div class="author">By Michael Glen</div>

<p>Fran booted up his tablet and Googled for the song that kept coming back to him; the Peter, Paul and Mary version. He had forgotten that the inimitable Joan Baez had also recorded it. The second surprise was seeing that it was written back in 1905 by someone called Elizabeth Cotten. To add to his discoveries, he read that Joan Baez's mother came from Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The song brought back memories of childhood, living in Lanarkshire next to the busy railway line used by long goods trains that rumbled past in the middle of the night. Despite all the lorries on the roads, the bulky cars and flat-bed wagons behind the powerful locomotives still carried the 'stuff', as he used to call it, past a house he no longer lived in.</p>
<p>He arrived in the evening in Carcassonne on a TER train from Toulouse. He stepped down from the carriage just seconds before a dusty, thrusting freight train, full of fruit and vegetables from Spain, thundered through the station. <em>Freight train, freight train going so fast</em>, he sang to himself. Up till then, he'd never considered who wrote the words; that was why he'd determined to find out.</p>
<p>He had booked a room &mdash; with Wi-Fi &mdash; at the <em>l'H&ocirc;tel du Soleil le Terminus,</em> the splendid <em>Beaux Arts</em> establishment near the <em>Canal du Midi.</em> It retained its aesthetic opulence from the early 1900s despite the little restaurant along the pavement outside. So many French towns have an <em>H&ocirc;tel le Terminus</em> but this one was special.</p>
<p>He checked in at the high desk in the soaring atrium, so large that the huge scattered sofas seemed quite insignificant. He remembered the grand staircase, palace-like corridors and sturdy bedroom doors from his last visit and was delighted that his room had a view of the <em>Square Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier.</em> Was the poet 'square' too? <em>This is a treat, he murmured. Expensive, but what the hell. I won't be here forever.</em></p>
<p>It was no prediction; it was a promise. A commitment. Fran, Francis Xavier MacMorran from birth, had run, as he liked to put it, his course. He had not even questioned the consultant who, supported by evidence of Fran's out-of-control malignant tumour, signed his death warrant.</p>
<p>"I can't guarantee you more than a few weeks," he said and paused, waiting for Fran's reaction. There was none. "And no, it's inoperable. Or, at least, it's operable but the result would be fatal. I wouldn't even contemplate it."</p>
<p>Fran remained apparently unmoved. "In which case, I'd better take that holiday in France I was planning. Thanks for being honest. It's just one more on my long list of 'nearlies'."</p>
<p>Hugh Summerville, the consultant, looked at him, his expression querying what Fran had said.</p>
<p>"I've nearly made old age," he explained. "I'm one of Scotland's nearly men. The guys who get their fingertips on the mountain top before slipping down. Like William Wallace, Bonnie Prince Charlie&hellip;" He dropped his head briefly before looking at Hugh.</p>
<p>"Where do you want me to start?" He got no reaction. "I nearly got a good degree, I nearly got a top job, I nearly made a success of my marriage &mdash; and of my children. I nearly got my novel published, nearly fell in love again, nearly learnt to speak French fluently."</p>
<p>Hugh smiled and spoke quietly. "In that case, why don't you start on the last one and enjoy your holiday at the same time. It's nearly time for your singular achievement &mdash; the ultimate conclusion."</p>
<p>"No hint of compassion there," said Fran. "Thanks. I'll park the self-pity and get on a plane to Paris. I really want to see the re-vamped Picasso Museum and the brilliant Citro&euml;n showroom. It was nearly open when I last visited."</p>
<p>And so he tidied his house, made sure his papers were as much in order as he could be bothered and left a key with neighbours, telling them if anything happened to call his lawyer, Bernie Cowan, who would know what to do. He explained nothing &mdash; although he nearly did.</p>
<p>Paris was a blur of trying to do too much in too little time. He revisited the Rodin museum with its magnificent <em>Burghers of Calais</em> and the <em>Thinker.</em> He wandered down the <em>Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es</em> to see Manuelle Gautrand's electrifying showroom with its equally exhilarating concept Citro&euml;n. At a matching, breathtaking cost, he lingered outside over a lunch of scrambled egg with smoked salmon, two glasses of wine and a double espresso. <em>I won't do this again in a hurry,</em> he smiled. <em>In fact, I won't do it again.</em></p>
<p>He nearly slept, alone in a first-class four-berth sleeper, all the way to Toulouse where he re-visited the towering mediaeval Basilique St Sernin. He was an atheist with a perverse affection for this great brick Romanesque monument with its battered stone pillars inside. It had offered him inspiration (divine intervention?) when trying to compose a eulogy for a dead friend whose funeral was two hours away. "Norman was a great cathedral of a man," were his opening words and there was nearly a round of applause in the crematorium.</p>
<p><em>That was his funeral,</em> Fran quipped. <em>There's no one to say that of me.</em> Maybe: <em>Fran was nearly a great achiever.</em></p>
<p>A memorable evening meal followed by a glass or two of Calva (even this far south) put paid to further introspection. <em>Carpe diem,</em> or in this case, <em>noctem.</em> He'd have liked to seize something a little more corporeal but there were no candidates so he slept the sleep of the virtuous under an expensive duvet.</p>
<p>And so on to Carcassonne, a place where he felt 'comfortable'. On his first visit one summer, he had emerged from Ryanair's conditioned air into a cauldron of sweltering humidity; this really was being on holiday. He enjoyed exploring the <em>Cit&eacute;,</em> a kind of fairy-tale reconstruction on a Disneyland scale and now over-run by sweaty visitors. He quite liked the tortuous board game it spawned but never even nearly defeated his grandchildren.</p>
<p>He spent happy hours walking the streets of the old town, laid out in 'a grid with variations', admiring its flashes of Art Deco and exploring the <em>Librairie Breithaupt</em> with its maze of books, elegant stationery, dazzling art materials, stylish gifts and more. When Fran had left after his first visit, he was disoriented until he realised he had entered from <em>Rue Courtejaire</em> and left by the doorway on <em>Rue de Verdun.</em></p>
<p>That night he made up his mind. He was as relaxed as he had felt in years; he was in a place that he cared about but where nobody cared about him. It was time for the last hurrah. He spent the next evening at <em>La Gare</em> and in slightly-halting French chatted to one of the platform staff about freight trains.</p>
<p>"Tous les soirs, Monsieur. En provenance d'Espagne et en direction de Paris."</p>
<p>"C'est vrai?" Fran nodded in, he hoped, a knowing fashion.</p>
<p>"Oui, et toujours &agrave; l'heure. C'est une nouvelle compagnie."</p>
<p>Always on time, Fran noted. Any railway company would do; he wasn't fussy.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, he took <em>Lou Gabaret</em>, the trip boat on its <em>Croisi&eacute;re Nature,</em> westwards on the <em>Canal du Midi.</em> The spring weather was glorious and on the way back they stopped at <em>l'&Eacute;panchoir de Foucaud,</em> the spillway whose waters irrigate the pleasing botanical garden that straddles it. He savoured several glasses of local wine to wash down several pieces of rich patisserie.</p>
<p>He sat in the sunshine until the girl shut up shop. "I'm getting a lift from a friend; that's why I didn't go back on the boat," he explained.</p>
<p>"D'accord, et bonsoir!" she called cheerily as she closed the shutters. <em>What next time, Francis Xavier?</em></p>
<p>He made his way to the nearby road, then to the railway bridge and climbed the fence up to the track. There was nobody within sight.</p>
<p>He knew the line had been singled some distance to the west, so he turned and, with the setting sun on his back, walked eastwards along the track. He could conceal himself in bushes until <em>le grand train de marchandises</em> approached. He was nearly looking forward to seeing it; except that he wouldn't see it.</p>
<p>When his watch told him the train was passing through Carcassonne, he kneeled on a sleeper between the rails, facing the way the train would be travelling. He was happy now. <em>The party's over,</em> he sang, fondly remembering Peggy Lee. <em>It's time to call it a day.</em></p>
<p>The rails beside him began singing as the pounding of steel on steel started to reach him. He waited, daring not to look back, and waited, and waited. The noise became increasingly fearsome but he wasn't afraid. He stood up, slowly folded his arms, smiled and shouted "Vive la Mort!"</p>
<p>He was still standing up as the train hammered on into the night. <em>How could I forget? Bloody French trains run on the left,</em> he cursed.</p>
<p>The nearly man had nearly done it. Again.</p>
