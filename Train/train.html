booted up his tablet and Googled for the song that kept coming back to him; the
Peter, Paul and Mary version. He had forgotten that the inimitable Joan Baez
had also recorded it. The second surprise was seeing that it was written back
in 1905 by someone called Elizabeth <span class=SpellE>Cotten</span>. To add to
his discoveries, he read that Joan Baez’s mother came from Edinburgh. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

roads, the bulky cars and flat-bed wagons behind the powerful locomotives still

Carcassonne on a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>TER </i>train from

thrusting freight train, full of fruit and vegetables from Spain, thundered
through the station. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Freight train,

opulence from the early 1900s despite the little restaurant along the pavement
outside. So many French towns have an <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

checked in at the high desk in the soaring atrium, so large that the huge

palace-like corridors and sturdy bedroom doors from his last visit and was
delighted that his room had a view of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Square
André <span class=SpellE>Chénier</span></i>. Was the poet ‘square’ too? <i

prediction; it was a promise. A commitment. Fran, Francis Xavier <span

course. He had not even questioned the consultant who, supported by evidence of
Fran’s out-of-control malignant tumour, signed his death warrant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

guarantee you more than a few weeks,” he said and paused, waiting for Fran’s
reaction. There was none. “And no, it’s inoperable. Or, at least, it’s operable
but the result would be fatal. I wouldn’t even contemplate it.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Fran
remained apparently unmoved. “In which case, I’d better take that holiday in
France I was planning. Thanks for being honest. It’s just one more on my long

lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>“I’ve
nearly made old age,” he explained. “I’m one of Scotland’s nearly men. The guys
who get their fingertips on the mountain top before slipping down. Like William

Hugh. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

you want me to start?” He got no reaction. “I nearly got a good degree, I
nearly got a top job, I nearly made a success of my marriage – and of my
children. I nearly got my novel published, nearly fell in love again, nearly
learnt to speak French fluently.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Hugh
smiled and spoke quietly. “In that case, why don’t you start on the last one
and enjoy your holiday at the same time. It’s nearly time for your singular
achievement – the ultimate conclusion.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>“No hint
of compassion there,” said Fran. “Thanks. I’ll park the self-pity and get on a
plane to Paris. I really want to see the re-vamped Picasso Museum and the
brilliant Citroën showroom. It was nearly open when I last visited.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>And so he
tidied his house, made sure his papers were as much in order as he could be
bothered and left a key with neighbours, telling them if anything happened to
call his lawyer, Bernie Cowan, who would know what to do. He explained nothing
– although he nearly did. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>Paris was
a blur of trying to do too much in too little time. He revisited the Rodin
museum with its magnificent <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Burghers of
Calais</i> and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Thinker</i>. He
wandered down the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Champs</i> <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Élysées</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>to see <span class=SpellE>Manuelle</span>
<span class=SpellE>Gautrand’s</span> electrifying showroom with its equally
exhilarating concept Citroën. At a matching, <span class=SpellE>breathtaking</span>
cost, he lingered outside over a lunch of scrambled egg with smoked salmon, two
glasses of wine and a double espresso. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>I
won’t do this again in a hurry</i>, he smiled. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>He nearly
slept, alone in a first-class four-berth sleeper, all the way to Toulouse where
he re-visited the towering mediaeval <span class=SpellE>Basilique</span> St <span
class=SpellE>Sernin</span>. He was an atheist with a perverse affection for
this great brick Romanesque monument with its battered stone pillars inside. It
had offered him inspiration (divine intervention?) when trying to compose a
eulogy for a dead friend whose funeral was two hours away. “Norman was a great
cathedral of a man,” were his opening words and there was nearly a round of
applause in the crematorium.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span

memorable evening meal followed by a glass or two of Calva (even this far
south) put paid to further introspection. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Carpe
diem</i>, or in this case, <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>noctem</i></span>. He’d have liked to seize something a little more
corporeal but there were no candidates so he slept the sleep of the virtuous
under an expensive duvet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>And so on
to Carcassonne, a place where he felt ‘comfortable’. On his first visit one
summer, he had emerged from Ryanair’s conditioned air into a cauldron of
sweltering humidity; this really was being on holiday. He enjoyed exploring the
<span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Cité</i></span>, a
kind of fairy-tale reconstruction on a Disneyland scale and now over-run by
sweaty visitors. He quite liked the tortuous board game it spawned but never
even nearly defeated his grandchildren. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;line-height:115%'><span
lang=EN-GB style='font-family:"Trebuchet MS";mso-ansi-language:EN-GB'>He spent

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> <span class=SpellE>Breithaupt</span></i>
with its maze of books, elegant stationery, dazzling art materials, stylish
gifts and more. When Fran had left after his first visit, he was disoriented
until he realised he had entered from <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Rue

night he made up his mind. He was as relaxed as he had felt in years<span

about but where nobody cared about him. It was time for the last hurrah. He
spent the next evening at <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>La <span

the platform staff about freight trains. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
